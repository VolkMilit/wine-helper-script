# wine script v1.5.0

Just a little script, debian package and a zsh compiletion module for my personal use.

## Changes
- Cleaning outdated code
- Now script detected runtimes, and if not found it, just use none by default
- Now you may change working directory needs by script (planning to add ini\conf)
- Downloading the lastes wine-staging (working only for Debian users for now (Mint and Ubuntu have ppa for wine-staging), mb in next version I do it for other system)

## TODO
- Parse ini file (mb rewrite to python or other script language)

## Dependings
- bash >= 4
- wget >= 1.xx
- sed >= 4.x.x
